This repository contains code imported from my CodeHS IDE, which I use in sandbox mode for school development. Due to limited access (GitHub is blocked at school), uploads may appear in bulk as I occasionally forget to upload or transfer multiple files at once from my backups. Feel free to explore, and I appreciate any feedback!
